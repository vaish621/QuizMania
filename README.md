I have developed a quiz maker application using the MERN stack, allowing users to create quizzes and participate in them. The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS to create a clean and responsive user interface. This project integrates MongoDB for data storage, Express.js and Node.js for backend operations, and React for dynamic frontend interactions. Users can create custom quizzes by adding questions and multiple-choice options, and others can attend these quizzes with immediate feedback on their answers.
